RSV-influenza co-infection transmission in the UK

Abbreviations: RSV: Respiratory syncytial virus; IF: Influenza

This project consist of two parts. 
First, a deterministic compartmental model is developed to describe transmission of IF, RSV and co-infection between these.
Second, some of the model parameters are optimised, with a particular focus on the co-infection parameters as there is little existing data in the literature.
